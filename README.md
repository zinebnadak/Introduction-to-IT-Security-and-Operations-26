# IT Operations & Security — Self-Directed Practice

This repository documents my hands-on learning in **IT operations, infrastructure, and security**.
The focus is practical: understanding how real systems are **built, deployed, secured, and operated** — not academic theory.

---

## Goals

- Understand core concepts in IT operations and IT security  
- Design and choose appropriate deployment models:
  - Public cloud
  - Private cloud
  - On-premise environments
- Apply authentication and access control methods
- Perform basic risk assessments for IT systems
- Implement:
  - Encrypted data storage
  - Encrypted communication (e.g. TLS/SSL)
- Understand system architecture, components, and dependencies
- Apply fundamental security principles in practice

---

## Scope

- IT & security fundamentals  
- System architecture and operations  
- Risk assessment  
- Cryptography basics  
- Deployment case studies  
- Users, roles, and permissions

## Approach

Everything here is treated as if it were **running in production**.  
If it wouldn’t hold up in a real environment, it doesn’t belong in this repo. (exception is the theory questions needed)
